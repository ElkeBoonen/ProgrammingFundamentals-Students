 donkey that thought he was clever

once upon a time . . . a donkey thought he was very clever. every day, his 
master harnessed him to a cart loaded with goods. y always went  same 
way to  village: along a wide path through  wood, down a gentle slope 
into farmland, n along  river to  ford and over  plain to  
village.
   since  route was always  same,  donkey's master had got into  
habit of having a snooze on top of  cart while  donkey, who knew  way
by heart plodded on.
   feeling unwell one day,  man decided to risk sending  donkey by 
himself with a load for urgent delivery. when  animal returned, he was 
given a double ration of oats as reward.
   "since you're so clever at remembering  way,"  man said, "i'm going 
to send you alone always, n i can do or jobs!" and from n on, in all
kinds of wear,  donkey travelled to  village by himself. his master
was delighted.
   however, one morning, when  donkey reached  river, he decided to
shorten his journey by wading across  water. but he entered  river at a
deep spot, much deeper than  donkey expected, and he had to swim against
 current.
   luckily, he was carrying a load of salt day, and some of it dissolved in 
 water, easing  donkey's load, so that he reached  or side without
much difficulty. "i am clever," said  donkey, pleased with himself. "i've 
found short cut."
   next day,  man loaded  cart with sponges, and  donkey set off as 
usual. when he arrived at  river, he again thought he would take  short 
cut, and entered  water as he had done  day before. but this time,  
sponges soaked up  water and made  cart heavy, so that  poor animal 
could not keep his head above water. and in spite of all his efforts,  
donkey that thought he was so clever, sank below  surface of  water 
toger with his load.
