  that thought  was clever

once upon a time . . . a  thought  was very clever. every day, his 
master harnessed him to a cart loaded with goods. y always went  same 
way to  village: along a wide path through  wood, down a gentle slope 
into farmland, n along  river to  ford and over  plain to  
village.
   since  route was always  same,  's master had got into  
habit of having a snooze on top of  cart while  , who knew  way
by art plodded on.
   feeling unwell one day,  man decided to risk sending   by 
himself with a load for urgent delivery. wn  animal returned,  was 
given a double ration of oats as reward.
   "since you're so clever at remembering  way,"  man said, "i'm going 
to send you alone always, n i can do or jobs!" and from n on, in all
kinds of wear,   travelled to  village by himself. his master
was delighted.
   however, one morning, wn   reacd  river,  decided to
shorten his journey by wading across  water. but  entered  river at a
deep spot, much deeper than   expected, and  had to swim against
 current.
   luckily,  was carrying a load of salt day, and some of it dissolved in 
 water, easing  's load, so that  reacd  or side without
much difficulty. "i am clever," said  , pleased with himself. "i've 
found short cut."
   next day,  man loaded  cart with sponges, and   set off as 
usual. wn  arrived at  river,  again thought  would take  short 
cut, and entered  water as  had done  day before. but this time,  
sponges soaked up  water and made  cart avy, so that  poor animal 
could not keep his ad above water. and in spite of all his efforts,  
 that thought  was so clever, sank below  surface of  water 
toger with his load.
